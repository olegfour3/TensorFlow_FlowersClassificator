# TensorFlow_FlowersClassificator
This project is the beginning of my journey into the world of AI. And is an AI trained with TensorFlow in Google Colab to classify flowers from their images.

The following approaches were used as a solution to the problem: ___augmentation and regularization (Dropout)___.
Also increased the number of learning epochs (20 epochs).
